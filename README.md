# Predict Health Outcomes of Horses
[Abstract] This is an individual project provided by <i>Walter Reade, Ashley Chow. (2023). Predict Health Outcomes of Horses. Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e22 </i> <br>
    
Classificational algorithm has been widely used in veterian and public health, apart from traditional linear and logistic regression, in modelling, classifying, and prediction. This project aims to use Tree-based classification models including `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting Decision Tree`,`XGB Model`, and `Light Gradient Boosting Model`to predict the outcome of the horse based on their health data. Through importing data, Explorative Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, data visulization, I trained and fine-tuned `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting Decision Tree`,`XGB Model`, and Gradient Boost DT to classify each molecular and output the result in `test` dataset before model fine-tuning & evaluate the model performance.

**According to the kaggle leaderboard, this project Scored 0.74393 (Public score: 0.79878, which is only a dummy ranking before final result), ranking of 495/1544 (top 1/3).**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Please use google colab or jupyter lab (Anaconda) to run this project. Make sure that the original csv file is under the code operation directory.

## Sources Used
This code and the corresponding data analysis framework is under the instruction of laioffer bootcamp and the Machine Learning (CSCI6505) in Dalhousie University.

## Acknowledgments

* I am grateful to Dr. Thomas Trappenberg for the instruction of ML course and the bootcamp for teaching & providing the framework.
